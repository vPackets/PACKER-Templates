## News

(2020/04/27) Added support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fosssa).

(2020/02/18) I updated recently my template to leverage the vsphere-iso builder (instead of vmware-iso); The vsphere-iso builder, previously maintained by JetBrains, has been merged with the Packer core in [Packer 1.5.2](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/v1.5.4/CHANGELOG.md#152-february-12-2020). It will be officially supported by the Packer team at HashiCorp moving forward.

I moved to the vsphere-iso builder for 2 main reasons:
* This builder uses the vSphere API and does neither require the SSH service running on the ESXi host nor ESXi host modification (GuestIPHack enabled).
* I can use a distributed port group to connect my template during the creation.

## Overview

> **Note**: Ubuntu 18.04.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) are the only templates provided in this repository.

## Usage

Step 1 - Clone the git repository.

Step 2 - Edit the `var-ubuntu-18.04.json` or the `var-ubuntu-20.04.json` file.

Step 3 - Build the template(s).
